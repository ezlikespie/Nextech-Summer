# Nextech-Summer
A supervised-learning-based approach to determining infection likelihood based on core attributes using data from a simulated set of communities.

To use:
Run a web server with the root directory as "data-collection".
On Windows, this can be done by launching Internet Information Services (ISS) Manager.
Alternatively, any other http server works.

index.html should act as the home page if your web server does not set it as such automatically.
