			<p>This project aims to serve as a proof-of-concept for using machine learning and GPS location time series data to predict whether a user has COVID-19.
			In production, this would likely take the form of a mobile app which periodically tracks places a user has been.
			Through this and the power of machine learning, the app would find patterns in this location data and be able to predict whether a user is infected.
			Additionally, users that have been tested positive for the virus could report their infection status to the app, creating a positive feedback loop and strengthening future predictions.
			My goal with this app is to help create a safer environment in these hard times and help data scientists in better understanding COVID-19.
			<h2 style="text-align: center">Project Details</h2>
			<p>This website consists of four main pages: the home or landing page, this page (the about page), and pages for both data collection and data analysis.
			To collect data, I created a virtual interactive demo which is meant to simulate a community interacting through travel.
			Each person and location is represented by a small node, where each node - unless a location node - is able to move freely.
			Inside each node, there exists a few defining traits, which among many include susceptibility to infection and travel frequency.
			Travel data between nodes will be recorded over a period of time and used to train a binary classifier.</p>
